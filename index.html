<h1>My Experience</h1>
<center>
<p>The day started with us putting our bags in the Mrs. Sinclair Closet.
Then we headed to the main lobby. Before I got on the bus I squaded up with a couple of friends. We were joking the whole entire time. Then wants we left I started to go night night on the bus. When I woke up we made it to our destination.
		Upon entry there was an elevator and stairs so we decided to be lazy and choose the elevator which didn’t take long to decide. Then we meet sum people Robby,Ben ,Cameron, and wil. They teached us about the tasked that have to do every day. They even showed us some of the websites that they have completed and some that hasn’t been released yet. Then they gave us a tour of the building.
		The building is nice and cozy. The floors are well organized. You can also bring your pet to work if you choose to. The atmosphere is laid back and everyone is willing to help you complete your task. We actually took stairs when went to visit the part where they shoot videos for commercials and things. He was talking about film things in certain pixels do different things. It was very interesting but I didn’t understand not one word the man said. 
		I really like the tour. After the tour we of course got on the bus which by the way had a flat tire. We headed to cook out for lunch. I was ready to chow down cause I was starving all morning. It was my first time there and the food was good but it wasn’t jalexanders though. After eating I feel asleep on the bus on the way back to school which I didn’t miss at all.</p>
